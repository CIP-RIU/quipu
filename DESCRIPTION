Description: Gene banks increasingly use molecular markers for routine
    characterization of plant collections and farmer managed diversity. The
    gene bank of the International Potato Center presently uses a
    micro-satellite marker kit to produce molecular profiles for potato
    accessions. We have been searching for a compact graphical representation
    that shows both molecular diversity and accession characteristics - thus
    permitting biologists and collection curators to have a simpler way to
    interpret molecular data. Inspired by the ancient Andean data recording
    system we devised a graph that allows for standardized representation while
    leaving room for updates of the marker kit and the collection of
    accessions. The graph has been used in several catalogs of potatoes.
