Description: Gene banks increasingly use molecular markers for routine
    characterization of plant collections and farmer managed diversity. The
    gene bank of the International Potato Center presently uses a
    micro-satellite marker kit to produce molecular profiles for potato
    accessions. We have been searching for a compact graphical representation
    that shows both molecular diversity and accession characteristics - thus
    permitting biologists and collection curators to have a simple way to
    interpret molecular data. Inspired by the ancient Andean data recording
    system we devised a graph that allows for standardized representation while
    leaving room for updates of the marker kit and the collection of
    accessions. The graph has been used in several catalogs of potato native
    varieties.
