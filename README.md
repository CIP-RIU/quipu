 The chart shows SSR marker weights on a linear scale where each allele or 'gel band' is represented by a circle. The circle's diameter is sized inversely by its rareness within the set of accessions in the database at hand and within that locus. The purpose is to facilitate the visual screening
and comparison of genotypes with regard to these two questions:
 
What is the overall pattern of alleles in a genotype?
 
Which genotypes have rare alleles?

Genebanks increasingly use molecular markers for routine
    characterization of ex-situ collections and farmer managed diversity. CIP's
    (International Potato Center) genebank presently uses a SSR marker-kit to
    produce molecular profiles for potato accessions. We have been searching
    for a compact graphical representation that shows both
    molecular diversity and accession characteristics - thus permitting
    biologists and collection curators to have a simpler way to interpret
    high-volume data. Inspired by the ancient Andean quipus we devised a graph
    that allows for standardized representation while leaving room for updates
    of the marker kit and the collection of accessions. The graph has been used
    in several CIP publications.
