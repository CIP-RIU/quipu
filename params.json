The circle's diameter is sized inversely by its rareness within the set of accessions in the database at hand and within that locus. The purpose is to facilitate the visual screening\r\nand comparison of genotypes with regard to these two questions:\r\n \r\nWhat is the overall pattern of alleles in a genotype?\r\n \r\nWhich genotypes have rare alleles?\r\n\r\nGenebanks increasingly use molecular markers for routine\r\n    characterization of ex-situ collections and farmer managed diversity. CIP's\r\n    (International Potato Center) genebank presently uses a SSR marker-kit to\r\n    produce molecular profiles for potato accessions. We have been searching\r\n    for a compact graphical representation that shows both\r\n    molecular diversity and accession characteristics - thus permitting\r\n    biologists and collection curators to have a simpler way to interpret\r\n    high-volume data. Inspired by the ancient Andean quipus we devised a graph\r\n    that allows for standardized representation while leaving room for updates\r\n    of the marker kit and the collection of accessions. The graph has been used\r\n    in several CIP publications.\r\n    \r\nA sample image showing a fully annotated chart (parameter 'layout = \"full\"':\r\n\r\n![Sample quipu image](img/sample.1.jpg)\r\n\r\nA sample image showing a minimal chart (parameter 'layout = \"no text\"':\r\n\r\n![Sample quipu image](img/no_text.png)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
